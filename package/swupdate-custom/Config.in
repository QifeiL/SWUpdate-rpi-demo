	  swupdate-custom provides a reliable way to update the software on an
	  embedded system.

	  swupdate-custom is highly configurable to fit the targets requirements and
	  to minimize the footprint. The provided default configuration file
	  BR2_PACKAGE_SWUPDATE_CUSTOM_CONFIG will enable swupdate-custom with an embedded
	  webserver, a parser and a handler for raw NAND or NOR flash.

	  The default configuration file builds a reasonable firmware update
	  system with minimal external dependencies in my mind. If you like to
	  use your own modified configuration, you have to select the
	  necessary packages manually:

	  * Select BR2_PACKAGE_LUA if you want to have Lua support.
	  * Select BR2_LIBCURL if you want to use the download feature.
	  * Select BR2_PACKAGE_OPENSSL is you want to add encryptions support
	    to the webserver.
	  * Select BR2_PACKAGE_MTD if you want to use swupdate-custom with UBI
	    partitions.
	  * Select BR2_PACKAGE_ZLIB if you want to deal with gzip compressed
	    archives.
	  * Select BR2_PACKAGE_UBOOT_TOOLS and BR2_PACKAGE_ZLIB to add support
	    for setting the U-Boot environment.
